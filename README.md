# SDCC_project_22-23
Final project for the course Distributed Systems &amp; Cloud Computing

☁️CLOUDY DAYS☁️

How to run our system? 
You can play with CloudyDays and create your own version by cloning this repo:

- git clone https://github.com/AnastasiaBrinati/SDCC_project_22-23.git

and then executing the ansible-playbook

- ansible-playbook deployment-playbook.yml

Add an inventory if you like it, however for the purpose of this project we limited ourselves at executing only in localhost.

Disclaimer: we didn't care for security aspects, most passwords and passwkeys are hardcoded and visible.
